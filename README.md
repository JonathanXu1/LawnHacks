# LawnHacks

Thanks for checking out my project!

# Introduction
LawnHacks aims to bring smart IoT control to the every day lawn watering system. Compared to conventional options that retrofit your system with expensive parts, LawnHacks uses less than $10 of hardware to allow for remote control, sensing, and monitoring of your lawn. It is designed so that you can plug it into your existing watering outlet will little hassle.

# Dashboard
The Dashboard is built using React and React Bootstrap. Readings and control are sent via Firebase Realtime Database, and weather prediction was achieved using the DarkSky API.

# Future Improvements
This project is always under improvement!
Here are some things I want to implement in the near future:
- Adding ability for users to customize their location
- Support multiple controls and devices at once
- Implement auth on the hardware level
- Landing page frontend updates
